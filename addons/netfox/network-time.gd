## When set to true, tickrate and the custom timer is ignored, and a network 
## tick will be done on every physics frame.

## Maximum number of ticks to simulate per frame.
##
## If the game itself runs slower than the configured tickrate, multiple ticks
## will be run in a single go. However, to avoid an endless feedback loop of
## running too many ticks in a frame, which makes the game even slower, which 
## results in even more ticks and so on, this setting is an upper limit on how
## many ticks can be simulated in a single go.

## Multiplier to get from physics process speeds to tick speeds.
##
## Some methods, like CharacterBody's move_and_slide take velocity in units/sec
## and figure out the time delta on their own. However, they are not aware of 
## netfox's time, so motion is all wrong in a network tick. For example, the
## network ticks run at 30 fps, while the game is running at 60fps, thus 
## move_and_slide will also assume that it's running on 60fps, resulting in
## slower than expected movement.
##
## To circument this, you can multiply any velocities with this variable, and 
## get the desired speed. Don't forget to then divide by this value if it's a
## persistent variable ( e.g. CharacterBody's velocity ).
##
## NOTE: This works correctly both in regular and in physics frames, but may
## yield different values.
