</a>

Machines took all jobs but one - urban blood sport. Chrome Carnage is a
multiplayer top down shooter set in vibrant chaotic cyberpunk cities. 

*Chrome Carnage* is a top-down shooter drenched in the glow of cyberpunk
dystopia, where hope is scarcer than a working vending machine. Rising sea
levels have forced humanity into overcrowded platform cities.

With everyone on basic welfare a mysterious underground app has the desperate
masses hooked: win brutal street tournaments, score hectic amounts of crypto,
and maybe—just maybe—eat something that doesn’t squeak.
