## Install

### Releases

Find the latest netfox under
[Releases](https://github.com/foxssake/netfox/releases)

Each release contains the addons, and a build of [Forest Brawl] for Windows and
Linux.

In cases of dependencies, a *".with-deps.zip"* version is included as well,
which contains all the dependencies of the addon. For example, *netfox.noray*
depends on *netfox*, so *"netfox.noray.v1.x.y.with-deps.zip"* includes both
*netfox.noray* and *netfox*.
