# Multiplayer fps example

A simple demo fps game, using [netfox]'s `RollbackSynchronizer`,
`NetworkedStateMachine` and `NetworkWeaponHitscan3D` to implement a
server-authorative model, while also compensating for latency with client-side
prediction.

To edit and/or run, open the Godot project in the repository root, and open the
scene in this directory.
