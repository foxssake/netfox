# Multiplayer fps example

A simple demo fps game, using netfox's `RollbackSynchronizer` and
`NetworkWeaponHitscan3D` to implement a server-authorative model, while also
compensating for latency with client-side prediction.

To edit and/or run, open the Godot project in the repository root, and open the
scene in this directory.
