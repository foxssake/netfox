### Asset Library

TBA

## Usage

Please refer to the individual addons:

* [netfox]
* [netfox.noray]
* [netfox.extras]

### Examples

#### Comparison sample

* [Simple example](examples/multiplayer-simple)
* [Example with netfox](examples/multiplayer-netfox)

To have a handy comparison, the same simple game was implemented with both a
naive server-authorative model and netfox. Running them both under different
latencies reveals the benefits of netfox's rollback logic.

#### Example game

* [Forest Brawl]

To provide examples of netfox usage in an actual game, [Forest Brawl] was
made and included specifically for this package.

It's a party game where an arbitrary amount of players compete by trying to
knock eachother off of the map.
