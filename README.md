## Install

### Releases

Find the latest netfox under
[Releases](https://github.com/foxssake/netfox/releases)

Each release contains the addons, and a build of [Forest Brawl] for Windows and
Linux. Each addon has its dependencies packed with it - e.g.
*"netfox.extras.vx.y.z.zip"* also contains both *netfox* and
*netfox.internals*.

> Note: For releases before v1.1.1, a separate *".with-deps.zip"* version
> contains the addon and its dependencies, while the regular zips contain only
> the addon itself.

### Asset Library

Search for the addon name in Godot's AssetLib or download from the site:

* [netfox](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2375)
* [netfox.noray](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2376)
* [netfox.extras](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2377)

### Source

Download the [source] and copy the addons of your choice to your Godot project.

### Enable the addons

After adding *netfox* to your project, make sure to enable the addons in your
project settings. Otherwise, Godot will present you with errors about
undeclared identifiers.

## Upgrading

If you're upgrading from an older version of netfox, refer to the [upgrade
guide](docs/upgrading.md).

## Usage

See the [docs](https://foxssake.github.io/netfox/).

### Supported versions

Godot 4.x is supported by netfox. If you find any issue using any supported
version, please [open an issue].

Forest Brawl and the other examples are written against Godot 4.1. They may or
may not work when opened with any other version.

### Prototyping

To try your game online with [noray], a free to use instance is hosted at
`tomfol.io:8890`, the same instance used by [Forest Brawl].

You can use this [noray] instance to quickly test your games online, but is not
recommended for shipping games. The instance has configured limits, and no
uptime guarantees are made.

### Examples

#### Comparison sample

* [Single player](examples/single-player)
* [Simple example](examples/multiplayer-simple)
* [Example with netfox](examples/multiplayer-netfox)

To provide a short intro on how to get started with netfox, and how it fares
compared to built-in multiplayer tools, a simple demo was implemented as a
single-player game, which was ported to multiplayer using both a naive approach
and netfox.

#### Example game

* [Forest Brawl]

To provide examples of netfox usage in an actual game, [Forest Brawl] was
created and included specifically for this purpose.

It's a party game where an arbitrary amount of players compete by trying to
knock eachother off of the map.
