#### Comparison sample

* [Single player](examples/single-player)
* [Simple example](examples/multiplayer-simple)
* [Example with netfox](examples/multiplayer-netfox)

To provide a short intro on how to get started with netfox, and how it fares
compared to built-in multiplayer tools, a simple demo was implemented as a
single-player game, which was ported to multiplayer using both a naive approach
and netfox.

#### Example game

* [Forest Brawl]

To provide examples of netfox usage in an actual game, [Forest Brawl] was
created and included specifically for this purpose.

It's a party game where an arbitrary amount of players compete by trying to
knock eachother off of the map.
